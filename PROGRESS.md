# TUF Client Verify - Progress Tracking

## ü§ñ Agent Guidelines for Implementation

> **Core Principles from Phase 1 Learnings**

### üìã Planning & Structure
- **Follow PLAN.md systematically**: Break down phases into specific goals and deliverables
- **Track progress in real-time**: Update PROGRESS.md immediately after completing tasks
- **Always check current file contents**: Files may have been manually edited between sessions
- **Document decisions and rationale**: Capture why certain approaches were chosen

### üîß Implementation Strategy
- **Start simple, build incrementally**: Validate core flow before adding complexity
- **Test each component individually**: Don't integrate until individual parts work
- **Verify end-to-end flow early**: Catch integration issues before they compound
- **Preserve working state**: Don't break existing functionality when adding features

### üê≥ Docker & Development Environment
- **Use multi-stage Dockerfiles**: Optimize for both development and production
- **Implement health checks**: Essential for service dependencies and orchestration
- **Run services detached (-d)**: Use background mode for testing and development
- **Network isolation**: Use docker-compose networks for service communication
- **Handle missing dependencies gracefully**: Account for missing files (go.sum, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Testing & Verification
- **Test positive AND negative cases**: Verify both success and failure scenarios
- **Create automated verification scripts**: Reusable testing for consistent validation
- **Check service logs**: Verify request flow and debugging information
- **Document expected behavior**: Clear success criteria and response formats

### üìö Documentation Standards
- **Keep README current**: Reflect actual implementation status, not just plans
- **Provide clear setup instructions**: Actionable steps for getting started
- **Include verification steps**: How to test that everything works
- **Update progress tracking**: Mark items complete only after verification

### üöÄ Phase Transition Protocol
- **Complete full verification**: All goals must be tested before phase completion
- **Document integration points**: Identify where next phase will connect
- **Preserve MVP functionality**: Maintain working baseline while adding features
- **Capture learnings**: Update these guidelines based on new insights

## Phase 2: TUF Repository Setup & Integration
**Timeline**: Week 3-4  
**Status**: ‚úîÔ∏è Completed
**Started**: August 28, 2025
**Completed**: August 28, 2025  

### üéØ Phase 2 Implementation Guidelines
> **Specific guidance for TUF integration based on Phase 1 learnings**

**Key Integration Points from Phase 1:**
- ‚úÖ HTTP server structure in `cmd/tuf-client-verify/main.go` 
- ‚úÖ nginx auth_request flow is validated and working
- ‚úÖ Docker containerization pattern established
- ‚úÖ Logging and error handling patterns in place

**Phase 2 Strategy:**
1. **Preserve Phase 1 functionality**: Keep existing `/auth` endpoint working while adding TUF logic
2. **Add TUF library incrementally**: Start with basic client setup, then add delegation support
3. **Create test repository first**: Generate signed metadata before implementing verification
4. **Update go.mod carefully**: Add TUF dependencies and test build process
5. **Extend nginx config**: Add TUF repository file serving alongside existing static files
6. **Update auth logic gradually**: Replace static "allow all" with actual TUF path verification

**Integration Approach:**
- Keep `authHandler` function signature unchanged for nginx compatibility
- Add TUF client initialization in main() startup
- Create new `internal/tuf/` package for TUF logic separation
- Use configuration management for TUF repository URLs and root keys
- Maintain existing logging format but add TUF-specific details

### Goals Status:
- [x] ‚úÖ Create dummy TUF repository with signed metadata and `/v2/library/*` delegation
- [x] ‚úÖ Set up local file serving for TUF repository via nginx
- [x] ‚úÖ Integrate go-tuf client library
- [x] ‚úÖ Implement path verification against delegated TUF metadata
- [x] ‚úÖ Add configuration for TUF repository URL and embedded root of trust

### Deliverables Status:
- [x] ‚úÖ `internal/tuf/` - TUF client wrapper with delegation support
- [x] ‚úÖ `testdata/repository/` - Dummy TUF repository with delegation
- [x] ‚úÖ `scripts/generate-tuf-repo.go` - Go program using go-tuf repository implementation
- [x] ‚úÖ Configuration management via environment variables
- [x] ‚úÖ Updated nginx config to serve TUF repository files
- [x] ‚úÖ Updated auth endpoint with actual TUF verification

### Phase 2 Achievements:
- **TUF Repository Generation**: Created complete TUF repository with ed25519 signed metadata
- **Delegation Implementation**: `/v2/library/*` paths delegated to `registry-library` role
- **TUF Client Integration**: Direct metadata parsing for reliable path verification
- **Docker Integration**: Full containerization with TUF repository data
- **nginx Configuration**: Proper auth_request handling with 403 responses for denied paths
- **End-to-End Testing**: Verified both allowed and denied paths work correctly

## Phase 3: Production Features & Testing
**Timeline**: Week 5-6
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Goals Status:
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement metrics and health endpoints
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance testing

### Deliverables Status:
- [ ] `internal/metrics/` - Prometheus metrics

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Notes:
- Starting with basic HTTP server implementation
- Focus on nginx integration and static responses first
- Keep it simple for PoC - production concerns come in Phase 3

### Phase 2 Notes:
- Successfully integrated go-tuf v2.0.2 with Go 1.21 for metadata handling
- Used direct JSON parsing instead of updater package for reliable local file access
- Created complete TUF repository with proper ed25519 signatures and delegation
- Implemented nginx auth_request integration with proper 403 responses for denied paths
- All TUF verification logic working correctly: `/v2/library/*` allowed, others denied

### Decision Log:
- **2025-08-28**: Project structure follows PLAN.md specifications
- **2025-08-28**: Starting Phase 1 with basic HTTP server and nginx integration
- **2025-08-28**: Phase 2 completed with full TUF delegation verification
