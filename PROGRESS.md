## Phase 2: TUF Repository Setup & Integration
**Timeline**: Week 3-4
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

### Goals Status:
- [ ] Create dummy TUF repository with signed metadata and `/v2/library/*` delegation
- [ ] Set up local file serving for TUF repository via nginx
- [ ] Integrate go-tuf client library

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Notes:
- Starting with basic HTTP server implementation
- Focus on nginx integration and static responses first
- Keep it simple for PoC - production concerns come in Phase 3

### Decision Log:
- **2025-08-28**: Project structure follows PLAN.md specifications
- **2025-08-28**: Starting Phase 1 with basic HTTP server and nginx integration

---

## Current Working Items:
- Setting up basic project structure
- Implementing basic HTTP server with /auth endpoint
